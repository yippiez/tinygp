class ARS(BasicStrategy):
    """Augmented Random Search.

    Algorithm:
    - Sample symmetric perturbation directions around current anchors.
    - Evaluate positive/negative perturbations and compute directional score differences.
    - Aggregate top directions into an update step with normalized scaling.
    - Move anchors and repeat.

    Intuition:
        ARS estimates a robust descent direction from paired finite differences, often with strong performance-to-complexity tradeoffs.
